# Flower_Image_Classifier

This project is part of Udacity's intro to machine learning nanodegree.
In this project I built a Neural Network and trained on the 'oxford_flowers102' dataset and used the trained model to build a flower image classifer application running from command line

**Requirments**

- Python(Anaconda packages)
- GPU enabled workspace( I used colab)
- Tensorflow (version 2.1.0)
- Tensorflow datasets(tfds)

**Dataset**
The Oxford Flowers 102 dataset is a consistent of 102 flower categories commonly occurring
in the United Kingdom. Each class consists of between 40 and 258 images. The images have
large scale, pose and light variations. In addition, there are categories that have large
variations within the category and several very similar categories.

The dataset is divided into a training set, a validation set and a test set.
The training set and validation set each consist of 10 images per class (totalling 1020 images each).
The test set consists of the remaining 6149 images (minimum 20 per class).',
